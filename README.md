# Blackjack Expert System

## Description

The **Blackjack Expert System** is an intelligent application designed to enhance your Blackjack gaming experience by employing advanced card counting techniques. Unlike traditional Blackjack programs, this system goes beyond basic strategies and leverages the power of card counting to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes, providing you with optimal moves based on the current game state.

## Model of the AI

The heart of this system lies in the model of **card counting**, a technique widely recognized in the realm of Blackjack strategy. Card counting is a method used to keep track of the ratio of high to low-value cards remaining in the deck. The model is based on the premise that a deck rich in high-value cards favors the player, while a deck with more low-value cards benefits the dealer. The Blackjack Expert System employs this model to make informed decisions and suggest strategic moves.

## Inference

The system makes decisions by assessing the probability of the next card based on the current composition of the deck. Using the principles of card counting, it calculates the likelihood of drawing high or low-value cards. This information is then used to infer the optimal move for the player. By considering the probabilities, the system aims to maximize the player's advantage and improve overall performance in Blackjack.

## Generate and Test

The **Generate and Test** feature of the system involves simulating different scenarios by generating all possible hands. While counting cards, the system evaluates the effectiveness of its decision-making process by comparing the generated results against the expected outcomes based on card counting principles. This thorough testing approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of the system, providing users with a robust tool for mastering the art of Blackjack.
