# Blackjack Expert System

## Description

The **Blackjack Expert System** is an intelligent application designed to enhance your Blackjack gaming experience by employing advanced card counting techniques. Unlike traditional Blackjack programs, this system goes beyond basic strategies and leverages the power of card counting to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes, providing you with optimal moves based on the current game state.

## Model of the AI

The core of this approach revolves around a Markov model enhanced by card counting, a strategy well-established in the domain of Blackjack tactics. Card counting involves monitoring the proportion of high to low-value cards still present in the deck. The methodology is founded on the principle that a deck abundant in high-value cards favors the player, whereas a deck containing more low-value cards is advantageous for the dealer. The Markov-Card Counting Expert System leverages this model to guide its decision-making and recommend tactical plays.

## Inference

The system makes decisions by assessing the probability of the next card based on the current composition of the deck. Using the principles of card counting, it calculates the likelihood of drawing high or low-value cards. This information is then used to infer the optimal move for the player. By considering the probabilities, the system aims to maximize the player's advantage and improve overall performance in Blackjack.

## Generate and Test

The **Generate and Test** feature of the system involves simulating different scenarios by generating all possible hands. While counting cards, the system evaluates the effectiveness of its decision-making process by comparing the generated results against the expected outcomes based on card counting principles. This thorough testing approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of the system, providing users with a robust tool for mastering the art of Blackjack.
